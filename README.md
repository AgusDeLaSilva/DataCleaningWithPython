# DataCleaningWithPython

Skills: Python, Pandas, Data Cleaning, csv.

In this project we walk through the cleaning process of a database called "Customer Call List.xlsx" using Python (Pandas). The objective is to send a cleaned and readable table to the Call Center Department. 

First, we parse the xlsx. into a dataframe so then we can start the cleaning process: removing duplicated rows, dropping unnecessary columns and clean column by column and more.

The last part of this project involves the creation of a new df (df_call_table), that will finally be transformed into a csv file (df_call_table.csv) that will be sent to the Call Center Department.
